 # Question 2
 
 Imagine you're creating software for a book publisher.
 
 Your app needs to track the following information for a given book:
 
 - Book name: the name of the book being published
 - Copies sold: the number of copies sold
 - Author name: the name of the book's author
 - Selling price: the suggested price that bookstores should sell the book for
 - Year published: the year that the book was first published in

 **For each piece of information above, create a variable or constant (whatever is more appropriate).**
 
 **Then, use `print()` statements to briefly explain why you chose to use a variable or a constant for each piece of information above.**
 
 */
// Answer question 2 below
let bookName = "Book Name"
var copiesSold = 100
let authorName = "Author Name"
let sellingPrice = 20
let yearPublished = 2018
print("Variable means it can change in the future. The constant means it won't change. I wrote book name, author name, selling price and year publish as constant. Because they are all in the past, they won't change after the book is published. However, the copies of sold will change in the future. Because people will buy this book, so the number of the sold will increase. So I wrote it as a variable.")
